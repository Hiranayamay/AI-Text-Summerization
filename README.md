# AI-Text-Summerization
Overview
AI text summarization refers to the process of using artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques to condense a piece of text while retaining its key information and meaning. Here's an overview of AI text summarization:

Types of AI Text Summarization
Extractive Summarization:

Definition: Extractive methods select important sentences, phrases, or paragraphs directly from the original text and arrange them to create a summary.
Process: These methods often involve ranking sentences based on criteria like relevance or importance and then assembling the top-ranked sentences into a coherent summary.
Abstractive Summarization:

Definition: Abstractive methods generate summaries that may contain new phrases, sentences, or rephrased content not present in the original text.
Process: These methods interpret and understand the text using natural language understanding techniques, then generate a concise summary that captures the main ideas.
